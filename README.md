# Password_Cracker


To whomever is running and checking my code. I split my code into 2 different separated main files. 
1. Brute force attack (bruteForce_attack.py)
    -   Please re-write the abslout path to the salt file (line 6) and the hash file (line 10)
    -   Everthing else is stright-out-the-box, just plug and run. ;)
2. Dictionary attack (dictionary_attack.py)
    -   Please re-write the abslout path to the salt file (line 6), the hash file (line 10), the common word file (line 18), and dictionary file (line 34).
    -   For the common word list, please use 'common.txt'.
    -   For the dictionary word list, please use 'dictionary_466550.txt'.
    -   Everthing else is good, plug and run. ;)
Cracked.txt has all my cracked password. It should be 41 cracked and 14 uncracked password. But please re-run the program if you can as there is a case where the code does crack the password by my IDE just timed out due to the run time duration.
Thanks ;)

**Importent: Because there is two separate attack, you have to run one first and fill in the rest by running the other one.
***Importent: There might also be overlape in passwords when running both attack. Just ignore. Thanks ;)
